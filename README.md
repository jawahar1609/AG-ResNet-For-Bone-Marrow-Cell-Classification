# AG-ResNet-For-Bone-Marrow-Cell-Classification
For the proper diagnosis and management of hematologic diseases, bone marrow cells must be properly categorized.
Traditional manual classification techniques take a long time,
are prone to mistakes made by humans, and heavily rely on the
knowledge of subject-matter experts. In this study, we propose a
novel method Attention-Guided Residual Networks (AG-ResNet)
for classifying multi-class bone marrow cells using ResNet50 and
Attention Mechanisms, specifically Channel Attention Module
(CAM) and Position Attention Module (PAM). In order to
concentrate on informative features, our method takes advantage
of the classification problemâ€™s hierarchical structure and incorporates channel- and space-wise mechanisms for attention. On the
dataset for classifying bone marrow cells, we ran experiments
and got an accuracy of 97.13%. The findings show the value
of our suggested model for accurate and effective bone marrow
cell classification, which may have significant implications for the
early diagnosis and treatment of hematologic diseases.
